# Service Blueprint: SNAP Work Requirements

**Last updated:** September 10, 2025

## Overview

This service blueprint documents the complete process flow for implementing SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) work requirements, including application processing, eligibility determination, Employment & Training (E&T) services, and benefits maintenance.

## Part 1: Initial Application and Eligibility Determination

### Work Registration Requirement

**Policy:** All SNAP applicants must "Register for work"

- See federal regulations at 7 CFR 273.7(a)(1)(i)

> ✅ **Best Practice:** States should integrate work registration as part of the SNAP application and renewal form, rather than requiring a separate form or process. Most states do this, though not all. This could look like a checkbox near the end of the form, or it may be included as a condition of the client's signature with submission.

### Application Process

#### Client Applies for SNAP

**Client Action:** Submit application with minimum requirements:

- Name
- Address
- Signature

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Not all states' applications include questions that surface exemptions. The minimum SNAP application is name, address, and signature. Questions that would indicate possible exemptions may not be included, or the client may not complete them. Online applications tend to include more questions than paper applications.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Improve application questions to better screen for work requirements exemptions and compliance. Consider the placement of questions within the flow of the form, and provide framing to explain why sensitive questions are being asked.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Offer an exemption screener so that clients know if they might have qualifying exemptions that they should bring up in their interview.

#### Staff Register Application

**Staff Action:** Staff register the application, and need to check if the client already exists in their system.

**Staff Action:** If the applicant received SNAP before, staff might check if the client was previously exempt or subject to work requirements. Exemption reasons from previous certification periods might continue to apply.

### Determining Exemptions and Compliance

#### Figure Out Exemption Status

The goal is to determine if the client is exempt from work requirements, and if they're not exempt, if they are meeting work requirements already.

#### Exemption Categories

**Age and Household Exemptions (No verification required):**

- 18 or younger or 65 or older
- Living in a household with someone 13 or younger

**Work-Related Exemptions:**

- Working 30+ hours per week or earning $217.50/week
- Receiving/applied for Unemployment Insurance (UI)

**"Unfit for Work" Exemption:**

**Policy:** Clients can be exempt if they are deemed "unfit for work." Staff have some leeway to interpret that definition. This must be "obvious to the eligibility worker" or based on statement by a medical professional. If unfitness is obvious to a worker, statement from a medical professional is not required.

Reasons like mental health needs, injuries, or lack of access to a shower can classify someone as "unfit for work."

> ✅ **Best Practice:** Agencies should train and support staff to accurately identify if a client is "unfit for work" during the interview. States shared that this involves: 1) thoughtful wording of probing questions, and 2) can be easier if the interview is in person (i.e., you can see a broken limb).

**Discretionary Exemptions:**

**Policy:** States can also apply discretionary exemptions. Discretionary exemptions can be used for certain areas of the state or types of cases so that those cases are not subject to work requirements. Some states are prevented by state law from using them at all or they can only be used in specific ways.

### Interview Process

#### Client Completes Required Interview

**Client Action:** Complete interview

How this is done varies:

- Some states offer interviews on the phone, others require an in-person office visit
- Some states schedule a specific time, others allow clients to call-in "on demand"

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Interview completion is a known challenge for benefits access. Some known issues include:
>
> - Client may learn about a scheduled interview too late, or not at all, especially if notice is only through mail
> - Client may miss the call, or have to wait on the phone for a long time

#### Staff Conduct Interview

**Staff Action:** Staff conduct the interview and mark information in the eligibility system and in their case notes.

During the interview, staff should inform clients verbally of their responsibility to report certain changes plus how to maintain eligibility.

How this is done varies:

- Some may play a "Rights & Responsibilities" recording
- Some may not consistently include this information
- Staff may have a customized script to read based on the work requirements an individual is subject to

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Guidelines around who is subject to work requirements change. It's hard for staff to keep track of the different layers of how work requirements apply. Staff must also use the interview time to follow-up on incomplete or vague information from applications.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Develop resources for supporting caseworkers in exemption screening during the interview. Ideas include:
>
> - Interactive interview guides: Some states have versions of this already, where the eligibility system checks for exemptions based on data entered and provides prompting questions for the interview
> - Innovative training: including practice scenarios and roleplay

**Staff Action:** Staff might consult colleagues on whether this client's situation qualifies as "unfit for work." For example, a less experienced staff member may ask their supervisor for their perspective.

#### Post-Interview Steps

**Client Action:** At the end of the interview, the client receives information about next steps. Often times clients need to submit additional verifications.

**Client Action:** Clients could be referred to Employment & Training (E&T) services. How this is done varies: some may refer after the interview, others wait to refer a client when their eligibility for SNAP is determined.

### Database Checks and Verification

#### Database Verification

**Staff Action:** Staff may check databases for information that can demonstrate exemptions or compliance.

Different states and individual caseworkers check databases at different points:

- In some states, databases are checked when applications are registered
- Often databases are checked during the interview

> ✅ **Best Practice:** Databases can reveal that a client is working enough hours, earning income, or other reasons that would make them exempt from general work requirements. Clients are exempt if they are:
>
> - Working 30+ hrs or earning $217.50/week
> - Receiving/applied for Unemployment Insurance (UI)

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Integrate data sources to identify other exemptions. [View a list of potential sources]

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Improve use of income verification services so that income and work hour exemptions can be found automatically. The Work Number (TWN) is commonly used but expensive and often requires manual effort to check and input data. Alternatives are trying to break into the market.

#### Verification Requirements

**Policy:** Not all exemptions require a verification. The state agency is not required to verify an exemption or exception unless it determines the information is questionable or otherwise required by program rules (e.g. disability status).

The following exemptions don't require verification submission:

- Age (determined by birth date)
- Pregnancy
- Receiving Unemployment Insurance (determined by data match in state's UI system)
- Presence in the household with someone under 14

**Staff Action:** If needed, staff will request verifications. [This FNS resource](https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/) outlines what qualifies as mandatory acceptable verification and state options. If a client is thought to be "unfit for work," the caseworker may request specific supplemental verification (i.e., note signed from a social worker).

**Staff Action:** Staff may call "collateral contacts" to get more information about the client's situation. Commonly this involves calling the client's employer to verify the client's wages and hours.

#### Client Submits Verification

**Client Action:** Client gets notice of verifications requested.

**Client Action:** Client submits verification to the SNAP agency. States must accept paper copies of verifications, and may optionally accept documents online or faxed.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Verification submission is a known challenge for benefits access. Some known issues include:
>
> - The notice may be unclear, or the client doesn't get the notice
> - Clients may submit verification insufficient to prove exemption or work status
> - The way that clients can submit verification may not be very usable
> - Clients working in informal or gig economy jobs may have limited documentation of work

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Ease document submission. Ideas include:
>
> - Chatbots or checklists to ensure clients are providing the correct documents
> - Functionality so clients can take a photo with their phone to submit documents

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Automate parts of document validation. Ideas include tools that:
>
> - Screen for common errors with document uploads
> - Validate documents being uploaded
> - Extract data, such as for tagging document types or entering data into eligibility systems that caseworkers can easily review

**System:** Connect verification documents with relevant SNAP case. Process could be manual or automated, depending on SNAP system design.

**Staff Action:** Staff process verifications submitted by the client. If needed, request additional verifications or clarify if a verification was insufficient.

### Eligibility Determination

#### System Processing

**System:** Eligibility systems run their rules on the data entered on a case to make the determination.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Staff may have to click in many areas of the eligibility system to determine if a client is eligible for any exemptions. Some eligibility systems have exemption logic coded in, but some do not.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Eligibility systems could automatically determine what exemptions apply based on what is input on the client's case.

#### Staff Actions

**Staff Action:** Staff manually mark in the eligibility system if any exemptions apply to the client. Based off of information from the application, interview, database checks, and submitted verification documents.

**Staff Action:** Staff run eligibility for the household's case and get an outcome and SNAP benefit amount.

**Staff Action:** In some states, staff have to set a benefits certification period for each case. Certification periods determine when a client would need to submit documents to maintain or lose their benefits.

> ✅ **Best Practice:** All exemptions should be documented, because some are temporary so if one exemption category ends another can kick in. States will document exemptions but only apply one, ideally prioritized by which exemption will last the longest if there are multiple.

> ✅ **Best Practice:** Limit the individualized decision making and any related manual updating that caseworkers need to do to set a certification period length.

#### Certification Periods

**Policy:** States can decide how they broadly set certification periods for SNAP clients. Regulation encourages states to choose the longest certification period possible (minimum of 6 months), unless the household contains someone who is considered an "Able-Bodied Adult Without Dependents" (ABAWD) or has temporary circumstances that might make them ineligible soon. Some states choose for all ABAWDs to have a 4-month certification period.

**Policy:** States participating in the Elderly Simplified Reporting Project (ESAP) offer 36-month certification periods for elderly clients. Clients on ESAP must be 60 years or older.

#### Client Notification

**Client Action:** Client gets notified of their eligibility determination and if they have work requirements.

This will be a paper notice, sometimes an e-notice as well. The notice should include:

- Benefit amount
- Certification period
- Work requirement details plus time limit details
- Exemption status
- Required actions

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Notices explaining work requirements are often confusing or unclear. Clients commonly do not understand what work requirements mean, and what they have to do to be compliant. This leads clients to lose benefits unexpectedly, and has downstream impacts on staff time to help.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Improve notices and communications when work requirements are first communicated to clients. FNS has created several sample notices and communication scripts that can be a starting point:
>
> - Notice Review Tool (NRT) - Consolidated Work Requirements
> - Model Notice - Consolidated Work Requirements
> - Model Notice (Annotated) - Consolidated Work Requirements
> - Work Requirements Oral Script for State Agencies

## Employment & Training (E&T) Services

### E&T Policy Options

**Policy:** States choose their own E&T policy: if they want to make E&T mandatory, optional, or hybrid. Some states pass law requiring state agencies to have mandatory E&T, while others allow state agencies to decide.

- Only 3 states exclusively have mandatory E&T: FL, KS, and UT
- 6 states are a mix of hybrid and voluntary E&T: ID, MS, NY, OH, SD, and TX

**Client Action:** Client could be referred to Employment & Training (E&T) services. In some states, all clients subject to work requirements must be referred to E&T. In other states, E&T is voluntary and open to all clients.

> ✅ **Best Practice:** Voluntary E&T is a simpler and better option for clients. With voluntary E&T the agency can avoid having to apply two different penalties - a disqualification period (for not fulfilling Mandatory E&T) and the ABAWD time limit - to the same person.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Mandatory SNAP E&T can lead people with countable months left to lose benefits if they do not comply with E&T. Participants who are working but not enough hours to be meeting the work requirements have to complete required E&T activities on top of their work hours.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** SNAP E&T services vary drastically between states and counties. E&T is typically very low touch, and there are mixed results on the outcomes of the services provided. But in some states, E&T services are a high-touch, 1:1 relationship: staff work with the clients to understand their goals, needs, and barriers.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** No states have enough slots to support everyone who would use Employment & Training services. Clients in states with Mandatory E&T could get an exemption from mandatory E&T sanctions, otherwise they would lose access to SNAP simply because they couldn't access E&T services. An exemption from mandatory E&T sanctions doesn't change a client's time limit on SNAP.

### E&T Process Flow

#### Initial Connection

**Client Action/Staff Action:** In some states, clients reach out to the E&T providers to begin process. In other states, E&T staff will reach out to the client to begin process.

> ✅ **Best Practice:** Ideally, states make hand-off as seamless as possible between eligibility and E&T. Implementation of hand-off to E&T varies dramatically across states.

#### Orientation and Assessment

**Client Action:** Client attends E&T orientation. Could be virtual or in-person. Some states hold standing weekly virtual orientation sessions.

**Client Action:** Client schedules E&T intake assessment. Intake assessments could be conducted virtually or in-person.

**Staff Action:** An E&T caseworker is assigned to each client and conducts an intake assessment.

#### Participation and Tracking

**Client Action:** Client participates in E&T activities: job skills classes, supervised job searches, etc. There are many different kinds of SNAP E&T activities: https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/snap-et-components-table-091324.pdf

**Staff Action:** An E&T staff must log the client's qualifying hours monthly. Depending on the set-up in the states, this might be logged in a separate system.

**System:** If the E&T system interfaces with the eligibility system, when the E&T staff reports that the client didn't meet the 80 hours the system will automatically trigger countable months. Compliance with E&T program can be shared to eligibility system, providing for active data checks. In one CO county, an ABAWD's countable months automatically start if staff do not enter the client's hours for participating in E&T activities.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Support states with integration between E&T and eligibility systems so that staff don't have to manually confirm hours across agencies. E&T systems can provide data to eligibility systems to determine compliance with work requirements (both SNAP and Medicaid).

### Information Sharing Between E&T and Eligibility

**Staff Action:** E&T staff can report "unfitness for work" information about the client to eligibility staff.

Different states implement this differently, some examples:

- E&T staff email a dedicated inbox or liaison who will forward that information on to eligibility staff
- E&T staff enter information into a shared system with eligibility staff who can then process it
- E&T staff encourage client to submit documentation to eligibility staff themselves

E&T staff often learn about clients' personal circumstances in greater detail than eligibility workers because of the nature of their work and intake processes. E&T staff can be valuable secondary screeners for time limit exemptions, but eligibility staff still must screen applicants for exemptions during the interview.

> ✅ **Best Practice:** When E&T staff uncover that a client could be "unfit for work," they should share that information with eligibility staff. In some states, E&T staff are able to submit verification documents on behalf of the client to help prove they are "unfit for work."

## Part 2: Maintaining and Renewing Benefits

### Work Requirements for ABAWDs

#### Time Limit Policy

**Policy:** If a client has work requirements and isn't meeting them, they can only be on SNAP for 3 months every 36 months. Each month that a client is not meeting work requirements will "count" towards the 3-month limit.

**Policy:** In order to meet work requirements, the client must work, volunteer, or complete qualifying training activities for at least 80 hours each month.

**Policy:** Clients who have to meet work requirements must "work" for at least 80 hours each month to avoid having a time limit for getting SNAP benefits.

"Work" can be any of the following:

- Work for pay, for goods or services (for something other than money), unpaid, or as a volunteer
- Participation in a work program (like SNAP Employment & Training) at least 80 hours a month
- Participation in workfare for the number of hours assigned to you each month (the number of hours will depend on the amount of your SNAP benefit)
- A combination of these programs or activities

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** It can be challenging for clients to track hours, especially if they are doing multiple activities to meet the 80-hour total.

#### 36-Month Clock Options

**Policy:** States have the option of how they want to implement the 36-month clock for clients who aren't meeting work requirements.

The three options are:

- Universal Fixed Clock
- Individual Fixed Clock
- Rolling Clock

> ✅ **Best Practice:** A Universal Fixed Clock to count the 36 months reduces the most burden on staff and provides the most flexibility for clients. This means the 36 months is counted from the same start and stop date for all participants, regardless of when they start receiving SNAP benefits.

### Good Cause Provisions

**Policy:** A client can claim "good cause" for not being able to meet work requirements that month to prevent having to use one of their 3 countable months. The client would have to know that this is possible, and how to report this.

**Client Action:** Client reports challenges and emergencies that are "good cause" for not being able to meet work requirements that month.

Such as:

- Medical issues
- Family emergencies
- Their car broke down
- Caregiving needs

A client would have to know to report this, and usually it gets reported either through E&T staff or the client calling or walking into an eligibility office.

**Client Action:** If a client can't fulfill their hours that month, they can report "good cause." States have shared that clients are not well informed of how to report good cause and have to know to do it themselves. Common "good cause" reasons include medical issues, transportation problems, and caregiving responsibilities.

**System:** "Good cause" can be retroactively applied if later discovered. This would reduce a client's number of countable months used.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Clients often don't know that they could report "good cause." "Good cause" reasons often get reported through clients describing their situation to their E&T worker, or after losing benefits.

> ✅ **Best Practice:** In some states, E&T staff reach out to clients to ask if they have "good cause" for not meeting their hours that month. In one state, a single staff member's job is to individually call every client who didn't meet their E&T hours that month to see if they have "good cause" for not being able to meet their hours for the month.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Text or email clients every month they are using a countable month and provide guidance on reporting "good cause."

### Reporting Requirements

#### For Clients Meeting Work Requirements

**Client Action:** Clients should report any changes that could impact their eligibility or make them not exempt from work requirements anymore.

**Policy:** Clients who have to meet work requirements must report whenever their work hours fall below 80 hours a month. Though a client is required to report when their hours fall below 80 in a given month, agencies cannot require clients to report hours every month.

**Client Action:** Client should notify the agency if their work hours drop below 80 hours a month. Client can claim "good cause" for why they could not meet the 80 hours.

**Client Action:** Client might be attending Employment & Training (E&T) activities in order to meet the hourly minimum. E&T makes it easier to report client's hours each month to eligibility staff.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Clients may not be counting their hours nor reporting when their hours drop below 80 hours a month, which can lead to a payment error for the state. Clients should report when their hours drop below 80 each month it occurs, but usually a change in hours is uncovered through E&T, or when the client has to renew or submit an interim report.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Clients often don't know what to report, or forget to report changes in a timely manner. Changes are often found through recertification or interim report forms.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Make it easier for clients to report changes. This includes making it clearer for clients to know when to report changes.

#### Processing Changes

**Staff Action:** Staff processes change report and re-runs eligibility determination. Sometimes the client has to submit verification for the change reported (i.e., for a job change).

**Staff Action:** Eligibility staff process the change, mark the client as no longer meeting the work requirement.

**Staff Action:** Staff processes renewal forms and interim report forms.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Staff may not have the bandwidth to process the changes in a timely manner. Change reports should be processed within 30 days, but all change reports end up in the same queue as other work and often do not get addressed quickly.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Prioritize within change reports to process more urgent changes sooner. Consider automation for low-risk change reports that don't impact eligibility.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Data sources can help discover if a client becomes eligible for an exemption, or has continued to meet work requirements. [View a list of potential sources]

### Benefits Termination and Renewal

#### Automatic Termination

**System:** In some eligibility systems, benefits will be terminated automatically after 3 countable months have been met. This is based on timers states have built into their eligibility system, and are not affected by the state's decision on certification period.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Clients often first find out they have used up their countable months when their EBT card hasn't reloaded.

#### Renewal Process for ABAWDs

**Client Action:** In states where Able Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) have a 4-month certification period, a client must go through renewal processes every 4 months. The client would have to submit renewal forms and may be asked to complete an interview, though interviews are only required every 12 months.

**Client Action:** Typically clients have to complete recertification forms every 12 months and interim report forms every 6 months after certifying.

### Regaining Benefits

#### Regaining Eligibility Requirements

**Policy:** Client has to be compliant with work rules for 30 consecutive days or must become exempt in order to regain eligibility. See the Code of Regulations for more details.

**Policy:** If a client with work requirements is found re-eligible, they have up to 3 countable months of SNAP benefits, but they must be used consecutively.

If a client stops meeting the work requirement again, they are entitled to an additional set of three countable months. However, these three additional months have strict limitations:

- They always run consecutively, meaning they cannot be used piecemeal or saved for the future
- They may only be received/used once in the 36-month period, even though there is no limit on how many times a time-limited participant could regain eligibility by again meeting the ABAWD work requirement and continuing to meet it on an ongoing basis

#### Re-Application Process

**Client Action:** Client re-applies for SNAP.

**Staff Action:** Staff process the application.

**System:** Eligibility system may automatically flag that this individual has exhausted their countable months already based on previous records.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Staff may have to manually override the eligibility system's defaults if a client had previously exhausted their 3 countable months in the previous 36-month cycle.

> ⚠️ **Pain Point:** Clients aren't aware of when their 36 months have transpired and that they could re-apply. States often do not contact clients when their 36 months have passed and they could re-apply for SNAP benefits again.

> 💡 **Opportunity:** Text or reach out to clients to let them know when they have used a countable month and provide guidance on reporting "good cause." Some states text clients after they have used more than one countable month. One state has a full-time staff member who calls every client who has used a countable month to see if they might have good cause.

## Key Implementation Considerations

### System Requirements

1. **Exemption Logic:** Eligibility systems need exemption logic coded in
2. **Countable Months Tracking:** Systems need timers for automatic termination after 3 countable months
3. **E&T Integration:** Systems should interface between E&T and eligibility systems
4. **Database Connections:** Systems should connect to multiple verification databases

### Communication Best Practices

1. **Clear Notices:** Redesign notices to clearly explain work requirements and consequences
2. **Multiple Channels:** Use text, email, and phone in addition to mail
3. **Proactive Outreach:** Contact clients when using countable months or approaching limits
4. **Good Cause Education:** Actively inform clients about good cause provisions

### Staff Support Needs

1. **Training:** Comprehensive training on "unfit for work" determinations
2. **Interview Guides:** Interactive tools to support exemption screening
3. **Workload Management:** Systems to prioritize urgent change reports
4. **Cross-Agency Coordination:** Clear processes for E&T and eligibility staff communication

### Outstanding Implementation Challenges

1. Variable state laws regarding discretionary exemptions
2. Insufficient E&T slots to serve all who need services
3. Documentation challenges for gig economy workers
4. Client awareness of reporting requirements and good cause provisions
5. Staff bandwidth to process changes timely
6. System limitations in tracking complex exemption scenarios
