# Development Documentation

This directory contains reference documentation for WorkPath development.

## For MVP Development

The MVP is intentionally simple. Most of these docs are for future reference when adding advanced features.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Documentation

- **[Troubleshooting Guide](./Troubleshooting-Guide.md)** - Common issues and solutions
- **Domain Knowledge** - See `.kiro/steering/medicaid-domain-knowledge.md`

## Standards

- Use TypeScript with proper types
- Use Material-UI components
- Follow the existing code patterns
- Test your changes in the browser

## Future Enhancements

The archived specs in `.kiro/archive-steering/archive-full-version/` contain documentation for:

- Automated testing
- Quality gates
- CI/CD pipelines
- Advanced workflows

These can be implemented after the MVP is complete.
