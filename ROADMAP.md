## Not Planned ❌

**Things We've Decided Against**

To keep HourKeep simple, privacy-focused, and offline-first, we're explicitly NOT building:

- ❌ **Cloud sync or backup** - Conflicts with privacy-first approach
- ❌ **User accounts or authentication** - Adds complexity, reduces privacy
- ❌ **Automatic verification** - Can't access state databases
- ❌ **Social features or sharing** - Privacy risk
- ❌ **Payment or monetization** - This is a public good
- ❌ **Native mobile apps** - PWA provides same functionality
- ❌ **Desktop-only features** - Mobile-first is our priority

---

## How We Prioritize

**Our Decision Framework:**

1. **User Impact** - Does it solve a real problem for Medicaid beneficiaries?
2. **Legislative Alignment** - Does it support HR1 requirements?
3. **Privacy & Security** - Can we build it without compromising privacy?
4. **Offline-First** - Does it work without internet?
5. **Mobile-First** - Does it work well on phones?
6. **Simplicity** - Does it keep the app easy to use?
7. **Feasibility** - Can we build and maintain it?

**User Feedback Matters:**

- We prioritize features based on real user needs
- If you're using HourKeep, your feedback shapes the roadmap
- Open an issue on GitHub to suggest features or report problems

---

## Release Strategy

**How We Ship:**

- Ship features independently as they're completed
- Each feature is fully functional on its own
- No waiting for entire version to be complete
- Continuous improvement based on usage
- User feedback shapes what we build next
