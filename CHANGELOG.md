# Changelog

All notable changes to HourKeep will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed - CI build (follow-up to the W0-slice)

`npm ci` failed on GitHub Actions with `Missing: yaml@2.9.0 from lock file`. Two defects, both
introduced by the W0-slice and both invisible to the checks that wave ran.

**The lockfile was not resolvable by the CI toolchain.** `yaml@^2.4.2` is an *optional peer dependency*
of `vite` 8.2.1 (pulled in by Vitest), and it conflicts with the `yaml@1.10.x` already hoisted for
`cosmiconfig`. npm 11 and npm 10 resolve that conflict differently, so the lockfile npm 11 writes is one
npm 10 rejects. Fixed by declaring `yaml` explicitly so neither npm has to guess: root gets 2.x for vite,
`cosmiconfig` gets a nested 1.10.x. **Verified against npm 10.8.2, 10.9.4, and 11.8.0**, plus a real
clean-room `npm ci` followed by the full gate set.

The underlying process gap: the definition of done checks `tsc`, `lint`, `test`, `format`, and `build`,
none of which touch the lockfile. `npm install` had left a tree npm reported as `invalid` and every gate
still passed. **`npm ci` belongs in the gate list.**

**CI ran Node 20, which the test toolchain does not support.** `@testing-library/jest-dom` 7 requires
`>=22`, `undici` 8 (via jsdom) requires `>=22.19.0`, and jsdom 30 requires `^22.22.2` or newer. These are
`EBADENGINE` *warnings*, which npm does not fail on — so the install looked fine and the tests would have
broken at runtime. Bumped to Node 22, added an `engines` floor of `>=22`, and stated the reasoning in the
workflow.

**The workflow never ran the tests.** The ADR-0003 no-verdict guard could only fail on a developer's
machine, so it protected nothing on `main`. Added type-check, test, and lint steps ahead of the build.
This does mean a failing guard now blocks deployment, which is the intent.

**Pinned the lint and format toolchain.** Regenerating the lockfile silently upgraded `prettier`
3.6.2 → 3.9.6 and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 7.0.1 → 7.1.1, which together produced 11 new lint errors
and 5 reformatted files across code this work never touched. Caret ranges meant a fresh install changed
what "clean" means. `eslint`, `prettier`, and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` are now pinned exactly.
The 11 React Compiler findings are real and pre-existing — `setState` called synchronously inside
effects, and use-before-declaration — but they belong to a deliberate upgrade, not to a CI hotfix.

### Changed - Truth in Copy (W2a)

The app stopped telling users things that were false, and stopped telling them things only their state
gets to decide. Details and citations in
`docs/hr1-readiness/waves/wave-2a-truth-in-copy.md`.

**Income guidance was wrong in the direction that hurts (gap 5.2).** The app said only earned income
counted and listed SSDI, unemployment, investment income, and rental income as **not** counting. Under
42 CFR 435.552(f)(2) the threshold is measured against **MAGI-based household income** (435.603(e)), so
all four generally do count — and so does **tax-exempt interest**, which 26 U.S.C. 36B(d)(2)(B) adds back
on top of adjusted gross income.

- All four moved to "what counts", plus tax-exempt interest and the non-taxable part of Social Security
- The "what doesn't count" list was **fixed entry by entry, not deleted** — it kept SSI and child
  support, which were right, and its gifts entry is now hedged to the narrow 435.603(d)(3) state option
  (cash support from the person claiming you as a tax dependent, where you are not their spouse or child)
- **A married user whose spouse works may already satisfy this pathway with zero hours.** That case is
  now surfaced instead of sending them after 80 hours of volunteering they may not need
- The message is two-sided: more household income helps this pathway, and separately there is an
  eligibility ceiling that points at Marketplace subsidies. Nothing implies a spouse's income disqualifies
- HourKeep still does **not** total household income. Household composition follows tax filing rather
  than who lives with you, so the app asks three screener questions and names the agency

**Hours and income are not either/or (42 CFR 435.552(e)).** The mode-switch dialog claimed that "only
your income" or "only your hours" would count, in both branches. States must add activities together, and
may credit income below the threshold **as** hours on top of that. Corrected in the dialog, in
`incomeDefinitions.incomeVsHours` ("Income OR Hours - You Choose"), and in the recommendation engine.

**No more asserted determinations (ADR-0003).** "You're Exempt", "✓ COMPLIANT", "Must Track Hours",
"you automatically meet work requirements", "You don't need to track hours", and the whole
"this is the easier method" family are gone from **78 lines across 14 files**. Replaced with what was
recorded, what the threshold is, the difference, and who decides.

**Three reassuring facts the app never mentioned**, now shown above the tracking calendar:

- If you already have Medicaid, this is checked at your **next renewal**, not on the start date
  (435.559(c))
- Your state must check **its own records first** — payroll, 12 months of claims, SNAP, TANF, school
  enrollment — before asking you for anything (435.557(a)–(b))
- **Be careful about volunteering that you're not meeting it.** A state can take that at face value and
  use it to deny coverage
- Plus: a notice gives you about 35 days, your coverage continues while you respond, and every other
  basis of eligibility must be considered first (435.558)

**Activity guidance corrected.** Work covers in-kind and unpaid work, not just paid employment; unpaid
internships **do** count and were listed as not counting. Community service can be court-ordered and the
organisation need not be a registered charity, but it does need someone who can confirm your hours.
School at half-time or more needs no hours at all, and the **school** decides your enrollment status.
Job training keeps the job-search exclusion with its actual nuance.

**Scope and dates.** 43 states plus DC are implementing, including Georgia, Tennessee, and Wisconsin;
the territories are not covered at all; the adult group **includes parents**. Added the two dates that
were missing entirely: January 1 2028 documentation hardening, and the December 31 2028 ceiling.

**Also fixed:** `SeasonalWorkerToggle` stated a "6 months or less per year" test that appears nowhere in
the rule. The export report's month heading printed the **previous month** in any timezone behind UTC — a
pre-existing bug on the artifact users hand to a caseworker.

### Fixed - Review findings (W2a)

The wave review found more than the wave did. Recorded plainly because that is the protocol working.

- **43 wrong CFR citations.** The ten exclusion categories are at 42 CFR 435.554**(c)(1)–(c)(10)**;
  § 435.554(a) holds the supporting definitions. Every category had been cited as `(a)(N)` and so pointed
  at an unrelated provision. Also `435.553(a)(5)` → **435.553(b)** for the post-release exception, and
  `435.552(e)(1)(ii)` → **435.552(a)(5)** for the no-combination rule. The numbering had been inferred
  from an unnumbered list in a summary rather than read from the rule
- **Four substantive errors survived in `definitions.ts`**, three of them contradicting corrections made
  in the same wave: half-time school described as contributing hours with an invented "6 credit hours"
  test; job search listed as a qualifying work program activity; the SNAP test stated as compliance
- **The veteran question told unsure users to answer "No"**, and asked about a 100% rating — which
  excludes veterans paid at the total rate for unemployability. Both fixed
- **Softened an unverified claim.** "CMS expects *most* people to be cleared" → "*many*". The majority
  figure could not be tied to a Federal Register page, and under-claiming is the safe direction

### Added - No-verdict guard (W2a)

196 tests. A three-layer guard so this cannot come back: rendered output, content data walked
recursively, and a source scan over TypeScript **and markdown** under `src/`.

Every layer was proven able to fail before being trusted, and each proof found something:

- Reintroducing `You&apos;re Exempt` went red in the source scan but **passed the render layer** — because
  `textContent` joins adjacent elements without a separator, so `You're Exempt` + a sibling became
  `You're ExemptR` and the word boundary died. Now walks text nodes individually
- The markdown scan was green **for the wrong reason**: a leading `*` was treated as a comment, silently
  skipping 59 lines, one of which held a banned phrase
- Test `TZ` is pinned to a negative-offset zone, because the month-heading regression test passed under
  UTC with the bug restored — green on CI, broken for most US users
- The dead-file allowlist did not assert **deadness**, so re-importing a dead component would have
  rendered `You Are Exempt` to users with the suite green

Three dead files are allowlisted with **W0** named as removal owner, plus four tests that go red when W0
deletes them, when an entry goes stale, or when one gains a live importer — so the handoff is enforced
rather than remembered.

### Added - Test Runner (W0-slice)

Stood up a test runner. No user-facing change. See `docs/hr1-readiness/waves/README.md`
§ "The W0-slice, and why it exists".

The slice exists to break a circular dependency in the wave ordering: W2a ships the no-verdict
guard test, which ADR-0007 promotes to Tier 1 and assigns to W2a, but the runner was scheduled to
arrive in W0 — which is sequenced after W2a.

- **Vitest 4.1.10** with `vitest.config.mts`, plus `test`, `test:watch`, and `test:ui` scripts.
  `npm test` in the definition of done is satisfiable from here on
- **jsdom, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `fake-indexeddb`** installed for
  the render tests W2a needs and the migration test W0 needs. All pinned to exact versions
- **`src/lib/utils/__tests__/imageCompression.test.ts` now executes.** It was orphaned: it
  typechecked only because `@types/jest` was installed, and there was no runner. 10 tests pass
- **Removed `@types/jest`.** It existed solely to make that non-executing file typecheck, and it
  declared the same globals as Vitest with incompatible shapes, which broke `npx tsc --noEmit`.
  Tests import `describe` / `it` / `expect` from `vitest` explicitly instead, so
  `compilerOptions.types` stays untouched

Deliberately excluded and still owned by W0 proper: characterization tests, the Dexie v6 → v7
migration test, the dead-code sweep, `/test-compression` removal, and delete-all-data.

## [7.2.0] - 2025-01-14

### Fixed - Assessment Flow Routing

Fixed conditional logic in the assessment/onboarding flow that was showing irrelevant questions based on previous answers.

#### Bug Fixes

- **Skip work questions for non-workers** - Users who select "No" to having a job now skip directly to the activities question instead of being asked about seasonal work, income, and hours
- **Removed redundant seasonal question** - Consolidated the separate "Is your work seasonal?" step into the job status question
- **Removed unused payment frequency question** - The "How often do you get paid?" question was collected but never used in recommendations, so it's been removed to streamline the flow

#### Improvements

- **Clearer job status options** - Replaced ambiguous "Sometimes" option with four distinct choices:
  - "Yes, year-round" - regular employment
  - "Yes, but my hours/income vary (gig work, freelance, etc.)" - irregular but not seasonal
  - "Yes, seasonal work (construction, agriculture, tourism, etc.)" - true seasonal workers
  - "No" - not currently employed
- **Proper routing for gig workers** - Gig/freelance workers now go through the regular income flow instead of being incorrectly routed to seasonal income averaging
- **Seasonal workers get 6-month averaging** - Only true seasonal workers (construction, agriculture, tourism) are routed to the 6-month income averaging flow

### Improved - Alternative Methods Messaging

Enhanced the assessment results and completion screens to show users how close they are to meeting alternative compliance thresholds.

#### Changes

- **Specific numbers for near-threshold users** - Instead of generic "not an option" messages, users now see exactly how close they are (e.g., "You're at 72 hours/month — just 8 more hours to reach 80")
- **Income tracking guidance** - Shows current income and how much more is needed to reach $580 threshold
- **Hour tracking guidance** - Shows total hours from all activities and how many more are needed to reach 80
- **Threshold proximity detection** - "Close" messaging appears when within 20 hours or $100 of thresholds
- **Consistent messaging** - Same improved messaging on both assessment results page and assessment complete screen

### Refactored - Unified Assessment Flow Component

Extracted the shared assessment logic into a single reusable component to eliminate code duplication.

#### Changes

- **New `AssessmentFlow` component** - Created `src/components/assessment/AssessmentFlow.tsx` containing all assessment step logic, state management, and UI
- **Simplified page components** - Both `how-to-hourkeep/page.tsx` (~100 lines) and `onboarding/page.tsx` (~130 lines) now use the shared component
- **Single source of truth** - Changes to questions or routing logic only need to be made once

#### Benefits

- Reduced ~2000 lines of duplicated code to ~200 lines of shared code
- Guaranteed consistent behavior between onboarding and retake assessment flows
- Easier maintenance and testing
